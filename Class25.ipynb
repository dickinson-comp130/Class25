    "This assignment is to implement the dice game [Pig](http://www.dice-play.com/Games/Pig.htm) for two players.  Pig is a simple die game played with 1 die and 2 or more players, but for now we'll limit ourselves to 2 players.  The player's take turns.  On each turn:\n",
    "- The player rolls a die.\n",
    "- If the die is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \n",
    "  - the die value is added to the player's *turn score*\n",
    "  - the player can choose to stop and add their *turn score* to their *total score*\n",
    "  - or the player can choose to roll again to try to accumulate a larger *turn score*\n",
    "- If the die is a 1, then the player's turn ends and their *turn score* is 0.\n",

    "- A *turn score* and *total score* is maintained for each player\n",
    "- The game continues until one of the players reaches 100 points.\n",
    "- The winner of the game is displayed.\n",

    "- Should be tolerant of incorrect choices and ask again if an invalid value is entered by the user.\n",
